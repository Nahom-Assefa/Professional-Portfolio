        <p> Hello my name is Nahom Assefa. Welcome to my portfolio page! Here you will see my portfolio content as I update in real-time applications applying my knowledge. 
            Before I describe my journey to the world of web development some brief things about me: I am of Ethiopian descent, I reside in Minnesota, I enjoy playing tennis,
            and my favorite food is lasagna. I love to read, and have a peculiar fascination for anything related to the intersection between technology, economics, and politics. </p>

    <div class= "about-p2">
            <p> I am a full-stack developer in training, and a full time Operational Risk Consultant at Wells Fargo. 
            I embarked on this new career path because I have always been longing for a technical skill set to complement the critical thinking skills I acquired in college. 
            I graduated from the University Of Northwestern Saint Paul with a B.S. in finance. Though I appreciated my self-discovery, foraying into the business world 
            was a different experience all-together. I became disenchanted with the work, the environment, and the prospects. By stepping into tech I am confident 
            I will be able to navigate the industry and apply client-side and server-side solutions to wherever I am assigned. </p>
